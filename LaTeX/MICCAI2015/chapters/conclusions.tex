\section{Conclusions}

We have introduced a new method for the automatic segmentation of MS lesions
based on convolutional encoder networks. The joint training of the feature
extraction and prediction layers with a novel objective function allows for the
automatic learning of features that are tuned for a given combination of image
types and a segmentation task with very unbalanced classes.
% Our model trains on entire MRI volumes rather than extracted patches, and
% provides much improved computational efficiency.
We have evaluated our method on two data sets showing that approximately 100
images are required to train the model without overfitting but even when only a
relatively small training set is available, the method still performs comparably
to the state-of-the-art algorithms. For future work, we plan to increase the
depth of the network, which would allow the learning of a set of hierarchical
features. This could further improve segmentation accuracy, but may require
larger training sets. We would also like to investigate the use of different
objective functions for training based on other measures of segmentation
performance.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Future work: use more layers to achieve a hierarchical segmentation
% method, but this paper, focus on the simplest possible network to evaluate the
% potential of such an approach.
% \item Used a simple model to reduce the risk of overfitting. In the future, we
% are planning to add more layers and use more filters and apply the model to
% larger data sets.
% \item We have demonstrated the potential of our approach for MS lesion
% segmentation, although the method is not inherently limited to this kind of
% segmentation. We are planning to apply this framework to other segmentation
% problems and we anticipate that other groups will adopt this approach to a
% variety of segmentation problems.
% \end{itemize}

% We have introduced a new method for modeling the variability in brain morphology
% and lesion distribution of a large set of MRIs of MS patients. Our method is a
% statistical model of brain images composed of three DBNs: one for morphology,
% one for lesion distribution, and one that jointly models both. We have
% demonstrated that such a model, which requires no built-in priors on image
% similarity, can automatically discover patterns of variability that can be
% parameterized in a low-dimensional space and are clinically relevant. In
% addition, our model can generate sample images from model parameters for
% visualization. For future work, we plan to incorporate clinical parameters into
% the learning stage using discriminative fine-tuning, which we expect would
% result in further improvements in the clinical score correlations. In addition,
% we would like to extend our approach to model longitudinal patterns of
% variability with the goal of predicting future clinical status from current
% images.
