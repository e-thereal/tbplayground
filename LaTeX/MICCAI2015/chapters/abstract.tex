We propose a novel segmentation approach based on deep convolutional encoder
networks and apply it to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in
magnetic resonance images. Our model is a neural network that has both
convolutional and deconvolutional layers, and combines feature extraction and
segmentation prediction in a single model. The joint training of the feature
extraction and prediction layers allows the model to automatically learn
features that are optimized for accuracy for any given combination of image
types and application. In contrast to existing automatic feature learning
approaches, which are typically patch-based, our model learns features from
entire images, which eliminates patch selection and reduces redundant
calculations at the overlap of neighboring patches and thereby speeds up the
training. We have evaluated our method on the publicly available labeled cases
from the MS lesion segmentation challenge 2008 data set, showing that our method
performs comparably to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we have evaluated our
method on 500 images from a data set from an MS clinical trial, and varied the
number of training samples from 5 to 250 to show that the segmentation
performance can be greatly improved by having a representative training set.
