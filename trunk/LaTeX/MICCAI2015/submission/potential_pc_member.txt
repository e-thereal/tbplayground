Dr. Marleen de Bruijne: Transfer learning, segmentation, MS lesion segmentation, recent TMI paper on lesion segmentation

Hayit Greenspan: segmentation, CT lesions, MS, met her at MICCAI. Was a bit awkward

Koen Van Leemput: A lot of brain segmentation. Also tumor segmentation. Hosted the BraTS challenge last year, did lesion segmentation 10 years ago.

Guido Gerig: lesion segmentation, but does a lot

Heinz Handels: Does a lot. Also has a paper on lesion segmenation (not MS) using RFs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hervé Delingette: from inria, but mostly segmentation using deformable models

Alexandre Falcão: segmentation but mostly live-wire stuff

Ivana Isgum: Segmentation of neonatal brain MRIs, but not lesions

Marc Niethammer: lots of segmentation work, but not brain or lesions

Sebastien Ourselin: brain segmentation mostly atlas based

Kilian Pohl: segmentation, registration, atlas-based, deformation-based, shape-based


Jing Yuan: a lot of segmentation papers in good conferences (recent work), mostly optimization person
