\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Future work: use more layers to achieve a hierarchical segmentation
method, but this paper, focus on the simplest possible network to evaluate the
potential of such an approach.
\item Better to understand a simple model first.
\end{itemize}

% We have introduced a new method for modeling the variability in brain morphology
% and lesion distribution of a large set of MRIs of MS patients. Our method is a
% statistical model of brain images composed of three DBNs: one for morphology,
% one for lesion distribution, and one that jointly models both. We have
% demonstrated that such a model, which requires no built-in priors on image
% similarity, can automatically discover patterns of variability that can be
% parameterized in a low-dimensional space and are clinically relevant. In
% addition, our model can generate sample images from model parameters for
% visualization. For future work, we plan to incorporate clinical parameters into
% the learning stage using discriminative fine-tuning, which we expect would
% result in further improvements in the clinical score correlations. In addition,
% we would like to extend our approach to model longitudinal patterns of
% variability with the goal of predicting future clinical status from current
% images.
